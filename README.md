# GoAPI
 Simple API made to get familiar with Go. 
 This is yet another(though a little more complex than the pong game) mini one-day project i made in order to get familiar with go, ahead of a much bigger project i intend to do soon.
 In addition this mini project allowed me to get familiar with the program Postman.

go run main.go handlers.go database.go in the command line to run.
